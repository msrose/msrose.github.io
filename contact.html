  <h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
  <p>Books I've read recently, and think you should read too.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Still Alice</em> by Lisa Genova. (This book will make you sad, but it's very powerful and thought-provoking.)</li>
    <li>The <em>Mistborn</em> series by Brandon Sanderson. (Fantasy, 3 books. Prepare to have your mind blown!)</li>
  </ul>
