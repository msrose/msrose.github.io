I've updated the [projects page](/projects) in order to brag about the cutting-edge (dare I say bleeding-edge?) breakthroughs I've made in computer science. But seriously I'm pretty proud of lots of the side projects I've undertaken, and I want everyone to know about them! Isn't that what this page is for?

So if you somehow find yourself here and haven't yet seen the projects page, please take a look! Check me out on [GitHub](http://github.com/msrose) if you like what you see. (I know you're saying to yourself "But checkout is a subversion thing, not git!". For such a line of thought, I commend you, and I think we'll be good friends.)
