  <h1>A new era begins!</h1>
  <div class="date">January 2, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
  <p>I've created this website because it's about time I finally made a good personal page to put on my resume. Once I found out about <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>, I was able to invalidate all the excuses I had been making for procrastinating: (1) I already have a personal page (a lie), (2) I don't have a good place to host it, and (3) I have nothing to put on a blog/website that anyone would care about.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>My first personal page was made a long time ago, when I was somewhat new to web dev. So going back to maintain it after a couple of years became more of a chore. And it looked like garbage; I've always enjoyed web design - CSS is my BFF - but I'm not very good at it. I don't have a keen eye for what looks good, so it takes me a really long time playing around with styles before I get something looking professional-ish. My first personal page was always destined to die, and I wish I had seen that earlier.</li>
    <li>For some reason, msrose.herokuapp.com is an entirely unappealing name for a personal page, despite the fact that I have several apps on Heroku and I'm perfectly happy with those domains. But msrose.github.io - that's a bad-ass 1337 h4x0r domain if I ever did hear one. Fear is thus stricken into all who hear and/or utter it. World domination here I come!</li>
    <li>If you've gotten this far I guess point 3 is moot since you are someone, and you care enough about what I'm writing to have gotten this far. Nonetheless, I have a few of the more polished of my side projects I'd like to showcase on the <a href="#/projects">projects</a> page, so there's at least something to put here. As for the blog, I don't care if anyone actually reads it - although I will just go ahead and assume everyone does, and prepare it for the scrutiny of the harshest blog critics of modern times. No, the blogging will be a literary catharsis for me - a break from the never-ending input stream of computer science and math I intake as a software engineering student. I actually took an English course last term, and I realized how much I enjoy writing. And when I get in the flow I think I'm a good writer if I do say so myself. Ideally I could write a best-selling novel and be satisfied that I have left a lasting impression on this world. However, writing fiction is damn difficult, and writing good fiction is even harder. So I will content myself with my plebeian little blog, and hopefully transcend to a true literary masterpiece (seemingly by magic).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I expect a lot of the posts I make will be about technology I come across - probably web dev related, probably stuff about JavaScipt, Ruby, C#, whatever I'm interested in at the time. And random things I encounter, whatever they may be.</p>
  <p>My only hope is that I don't let this website die - will I make another post? If I don't, one of two things will have happened, and I'll share them with you since I'm still assuming you care: (1) I've written a best selling novel before I get the change to blog again, or (2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1-NpyaOWV0">Salad Days</a>. If you get the Monty Python reference, I give you a 100% guarantee that you will enjoy 98.7% of my posts, so please continue to care.</p>
