  <h1>I Let It Die.</h1>
  <div class="date">April 29, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
  <p>"My only hope is that I don't let this website die." - An actual quote from the actual author of this page. And yet I let it die. More than two years without a post. Good job Michael.</p>
  <p>And I'm pretty much okay with it to be honest. I don't regret that I didn't blog more in the last two years, but I am bummed that I didn't have more motivation to blog more. My excuse will be pretty standard: "I was finishing up school, I was busy, blah blah blah assignments midterms engineering is hard give me special treatment pls". Ultimately that <i>is</i> the reason: any down time I would take during school was spent doing mostly brainless activities. Also I didn't set aside any time to write regularly, which was another mistake.</p>
  <p>You're probably saying "Okay shut up Michael we don't care no one's reading this anyway". But that's where you're wrong! I was actually reminded about my dead blog by an actual reader, a human person who I was not previously acquainted with, who took it upon themself to quote me to myself in saying that I had once said I hoped not to let the blog die! Aha! Figure out if <i>that</i> sentence is grammatical!</p>
  <p>But for realsies, that's what happened.</p>
  <p>For the last five years, if I wasn't in school then I was working as a co-op at various companies, and I should have blogged during those times. #noexcuses. (Yeah, we hashtagging now.)</p>
  <p>But I like writing and I think the stuff I have to say is pretty good. And now that I've unofficially passed all my courses and am about to graduate (YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW), I want to blog regularly.</p>
  <p>Here's my plan:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A post every week, let's say Friday night. I will make a phone reminder. It may be a short post. That's another mistake I made, thinking I had to lay out a prosaic plethora of paragraphs each time I blogged. Twitter is popular for a reason, I guess.</li>
    <li>Rewrite this website. It's okay as-is. It gets the job done. But I want to write posts in markdown and use a minimalistic static site generator, like <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>. That will probably mean brushing up on CSS stuff as well, but that's something I've also been wanting to do. I might try out something like <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a> and new CSS stuff like flexbox.</li>
    <li>Buy a proper domain. All the cool Michael and Michael Rose variant domains are taken as far as I can tell so I'll go for a meme domain like michaelrosetheboatashore.com. Fear my swagger.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Stuff I want to write about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Programming, mainly JavaScript stuff. I want to learn to write games in C++ as well so I might write about some discoveries I make there too.</li>
    <li>Speedcubing. I feel like I have a lot to say about solving Rubik's cubes fast although lots of that stuff is usually presented better as videos. Maybe I should start a YouTube channel (so that I can let it die, of course).</li>
    <li>Soccer. #KTBFFH. I keep up-to-date with Premier League and Champions League but don't catch games as often as I'd like due to my love for sleeping in. I don't have much deep analysis to share for soccer so posts will probably be short and along the lines of "Chelsea are amazing" or "Spurs are trash" or "If Leicester had won the CL I would have burned all my Chelsea stuff and become a Fox".</li>
    <li>Books I'm reading. Still on the fantasy kick right now with Brandon Sanderson being the predominant author.</li>
    <li>Video games. I like Dark Souls and its relatives, and I'm into <a href="http://speedsouls.com/Main_Page">speedrunning</a> them.</li>
    <li>Life. (You may have heard of it.) This will also include posts about blogging, which is attractive to me because it's so meta.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'd like to find a way to categorize posts so people can read what they want to read without too much noise. Hopefully there's some static site generator goodness that can help me with that.</p>
  <p>That's it for now. See you in probably two years with the next post [insert some quirky emoji here].</p>
