  <h1>Update ALL the projects!</h1>
  <div class="date">January 19, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
  <p>I've updated the <a href="#/projects">projects page</a> in order to brag about the cutting-edge (dare I say bleeding-edge?) breakthroughs I've made in computer science. But seriously I'm pretty proud of lots of the side projects I've undertaken, and I want everyone to know about them! Isn't that what this page is for?</p>
  <p>So if you somehow find yourself here and haven't yet seen the projects page, please take a look! Check me out on <a href="http://github.com/msrose">GitHub</a> if you like what you see. (I know you're saying to yourself "But checkout is a subversion thing, not git!". For such a line of thought, I commend you, and I think we'll be good friends.)</p>
