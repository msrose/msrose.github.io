    <h1>I Let It Die.</h1>
    <div class="date">April 28th, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>&quot;My only hope is that I don&#39;t let this website die.&quot; - An actual quote from the actual author of this page. And yet I let it die. More than two years without a post. Good job Michael.</p>... <a href="I-Let-It-Die">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>The Glory of Reading Week</h1>
    <div class="date">February 16th, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>Oh Reading Week, you always seem to come at the perfect time. It&#39;s not like there would ever be a bad time for a week of no school, but nonetheless, the timing always seems impeccable. Because of my co-op sequence, this is only the second Reading Week I&#39;ve ever had in the almost three years since starting my post-secondary education. And I dare say that it&#39;s the best reading week I&#39;ve ever had. Last week I had six job interviews, a midterm, several assignments due, and quizzes to write, and I somehow still managed to find time to slack off (there&#39;s always time to slack off). So this week is a much welcome break where my slacking off can be done in the comfort of my home.</p>... <a href="The-Glory-of-Reading-Week">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>Update ALL the projects!</h1>
    <div class="date">January 18th, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>I&#39;ve updated the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> in order to brag about the cutting-edge (dare I say bleeding-edge?) breakthroughs I&#39;ve made in computer science. But seriously I&#39;m pretty proud of lots of the side projects I&#39;ve undertaken, and I want everyone to know about them! Isn&#39;t that what this page is for?</p>... <a href="Update-ALL-the-projects">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>A new era begins!</h1>
    <div class="date">January 1st, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>I&#39;ve created this website because it&#39;s about time I finally made a good personal page to put on my resume. Once I found out about <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>, I was able to invalidate all the excuses I had been making for procrastinating: (1) I already have a personal page (a lie), (2) I don&#39;t have a good place to host it, and (3) I have nothing to put on a blog/website that anyone would care about.</p>... <a href="A-new-era-begins">Read more</a></p>
