    <h1>Fun with Array.prototype.push()</h1>
    <div class="date">July 29th, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>At work last week, I wrote some JavaScript where I was expecting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push">Array.prototype.push()</a> to return the array back to me. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve made this mistake before &mdash; but it&#39;s not a hard bug to find once you remember that push actually returns the new array length:...</p> <a href="Fun-with-Arrayprototypepush">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>Making my own magnetic Rubik&#39;s cube</h1>
    <div class="date">May 23rd, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>Magnetic speedcubes are all the rage right now. As far as I know, <a href="https://thecubicle.us/cubicle-labs-c-228.html">Cubicle Labs</a> was the first to really delve into and popularize magnetic cubes, and we&#39;ve since seen mass-produced ones from Gan and now Moyu. It seems that all the top cubers are using magnetic versions of their mains, and even 4x4s and 5x5s are being magnetized now....</p> <a href="Making-my-own-magnetic-Rubiks-cube">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS!</h1>
    <div class="date">May 12th, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>Chelsea are Premier League Champions, yet again! Needless to say I&#39;m thrilled as a supporter. Especially after a bewildering and dismal title defence last season. With Antonio Conte coming in I would have been happy with a top four finish this season, as I&#39;m sure a lot of the Chelsea supporters might have expected. After a slow start, the switch to a 3-4-3 system almost miraculously set us on a 13 game win-streak, which - when it comes down to it - put Chelsea in the driver&#39;s seat to lock down the title....</p> <a href="PREMIER-LEAGUE-CHAMPIONS">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>Rigging up a simple static-site generator</h1>
    <div class="date">May 5th, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>In many cases, coding something of your own from scratch is a bad idea, especially if it&#39;s a library that already exists. Why reinvent the wheel? Why waste the time working on your own solution when you have bigger fish to fry, and well-tested, well-documented, open-source solutions already exist?...</p> <a href="Rigging-up-a-simple-static-site-generator">Read more</a></p>

    <h1>The Glory of Reading Week</h1>
    <div class="date">February 16th, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>Oh Reading Week, you always seem to come at the perfect time. It&#39;s not like there would ever be a bad time for a week of no school, but nonetheless, the timing always seems impeccable. Because of my co-op sequence, this is only the second Reading Week I&#39;ve ever had in the almost three years since starting my post-secondary education. And I dare say that it&#39;s the best reading week I&#39;ve ever had. Last week I had six job interviews, a midterm, several assignments due, and quizzes to write, and I somehow still managed to find time to slack off (there&#39;s always time to slack off). So this week is a much welcome break where my slacking off can be done in the comfort of my home....</p> <a href="The-Glory-of-Reading-Week">Read more</a></p>

    <p><p>I&#39;ve updated the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> in order to brag about the cutting-edge (dare I say bleeding-edge?) breakthroughs I&#39;ve made in computer science. But seriously I&#39;m pretty proud of lots of the side projects I&#39;ve undertaken, and I want everyone to know about them!

    <h1>A new era begins!</h1>
    <div class="date">January 1st, 2015 by Michael Rose</div>
    <p><p>I&#39;ve created this website because it&#39;s about time I finally made a good personal page to put on my resume. Once I found out about <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>, I was able to invalidate all the excuses I had been making for procrastinating: (1) I already have a personal page (a lie), (2) I don&#39;t have a good place to host it, and (3) I have nothing to put on a blog/website that anyone would care about....</p> <a href="A-new-era-begins">Read more</a></p>
