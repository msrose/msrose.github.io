  <h1>I Let It Die.</h1>
  <div class="date">April 28th, 2017 by Michael Rose</div>
  <p>&quot;My only hope is that I don&#39;t let this website die.&quot; - An actual quote from the actual author of this page. And yet I let it die. More than two years without a post. Good job Michael.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m pretty much okay with it to be honest. I don&#39;t regret that I didn&#39;t blog more in the last two years, but I am bummed that I didn&#39;t have more motivation to blog more. My excuse will be pretty standard: &quot;I was finishing up school, I was busy, blah blah blah assignments midterms engineering is hard give me special treatment pls&quot;. Ultimately that <em>is</em> the reason: any down time I would take during school was spent doing mostly brainless activities. Also I didn&#39;t set aside any time to write regularly, which was another mistake.</p>
<p>You&#39;re probably saying &quot;Okay shut up Michael we don&#39;t care no one&#39;s reading this anyway&quot;. But that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong! I was actually reminded about my dead blog by an actual reader, a human person who I was not previously acquainted with, who took it upon themself to quote me to myself in saying that I had once said I hoped not to let the blog die! Aha! Figure out if <em>that</em> sentence is grammatical!</p>
<p>But for realsies, that&#39;s what happened.</p>
<p>For the last five years, if I wasn&#39;t in school then I was working as a co-op at various companies, and I should have blogged during those times. #noexcuses. (Yeah, we hashtagging now.)</p>
<p>But I like writing and I think the stuff I have to say is pretty good. And now that I&#39;ve unofficially passed all my courses and am about to graduate (YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW), I want to blog regularly.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>A post every week, let&#39;s say Friday night. I will make a phone reminder. It may be a short post. That&#39;s another mistake I made, thinking I had to lay out a prosaic plethora of paragraphs each time I blogged. Twitter is popular for a reason, I guess.</li>
<li>Rewrite this website. It&#39;s okay as-is. It gets the job done. But I want to write posts in markdown and use a minimalistic static site generator, like <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>. That will probably mean brushing up on CSS stuff as well, but that&#39;s something I&#39;ve also been wanting to do. I might try out something like <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a> and new CSS stuff like flexbox.</li>
<li>Buy a proper domain. All the cool Michael and Michael Rose variant domains are taken as far as I can tell so I&#39;ll go for a meme domain like michaelrosetheboatashore.com. Fear my swagger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff I want to write about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming, mainly JavaScript stuff. I want to learn to write games in C++ as well so I might write about some discoveries I make there too.</li>
<li>Speedcubing. I feel like I have a lot to say about solving Rubik&#39;s cubes fast although lots of that stuff is usually presented better as videos. Maybe I should start a YouTube channel (so that I can let it die, of course).</li>
<li>Soccer. #KTBFFH. I keep up-to-date with Premier League and Champions League but don&#39;t catch games as often as I&#39;d like due to my love for sleeping in. I don&#39;t have much deep analysis to share for soccer so posts will probably be short and along the lines of &quot;Chelsea are amazing&quot; or &quot;Spurs are trash&quot; or &quot;If Leicester had won the CL I would have burned all my Chelsea stuff and become a Fox&quot;.</li>
<li>Books I&#39;m reading. Still on the fantasy kick right now with Brandon Sanderson being the predominant author.</li>
<li>Video games. I like Dark Souls and its relatives, and I&#39;m into <a href="http://speedsouls.com/Main_Page">speedrunning</a> them.</li>
<li>Life. (You may have heard of it.) This will also include posts about blogging, which is attractive to me because it&#39;s so meta.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d like to find a way to categorize posts so people can read what they want to read without too much noise. Hopefully there&#39;s some static site generator goodness that can help me with that.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for now. See you in probably two years with the next post [insert some quirky emoji here].</p>
