<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
<p>Below are some personal projects of which I am particularly proud. I have a ton of other projects on <a href="https://github.com/msrose">GitHub</a>; feel free to give them a look, fork/pull-request/make issues - whatever tickles your fancy.
<section class="project">
  <h1><a href="http://github.com/msrose/linkadex">Linkadex</a></h1>
  <img src="images/linkadex.JPG" alt="Linkadex"/>
  <p><b>Technology Stack</b>: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript (jQuery), SASS, HAML, RSpec. </p>
  <p>Hosted on Heroku - check out <a href="http://linkadex.herokuapp.com/msrose">my personal Linkadex page.</a></p>
  <p>A dynamic bookmark management application - have a dedicated, customizable page for your links!</p>

<section class="project">
  <h1><a href="http://github.com/msrose/metapoints">Metapoints</a></h1>
  <img src="images/metapoints.JPG" alt="Metapoints"/>
  <p><b>Technology Stack</b>: Node.js, Socket.io, AngularJS, MongoDB.</p><p>Hosted on Heroku: <a href="http://metapoints.herokuapp.com">metapoints.herokuapp.com</a></p>
  <p>This application was a means for me to learn how to use Node.js and Angular, and it morphed into something of an idle game - you can use your metapoints to buy things that get your more metapoints. There's a lot of hacky stuff here, but I learned so much and really love the real time updates with Socket.io.</p>

<section class="project">
  <h1><a href="http://github.com/msrose/js-drag-drop">JavaScript Drag & Drop</a></h1>
  <div class="demo-wrapper">
    <div id="ddLiveDemo"></div>
    <div class="demo-caption">Live Demo!</div>
  </div>
  <p><b>Technology Stack</b>: JavaScript</p>
  <p>Some cool drag and drop shenanigans with vanilla JS. Try out the randomly generated live demo to the left, or go a little deeper and use the <a href="js-drag-drop/fiddler.html">fiddler</a> to play around with all the options. Ready for a blast of colours? Go see a <a href="js-drag-drop/index.html">randomly generated extravaganza</a>.</p>

<section class="project">
  <h1><a href="http://github.com/msrose/schedule-generator">Schedule Generator</a></h1>
  <img src="images/schedule.JPG" alt="Schedule"/>
  <p><b>Technology Stack</b>: Ruby, ERB for templating, CSS.</p>
  <p>Check out the <a href="schedule-generator/thesched.html">example schedule</a>.</p>
  <p>A schedule with beautiful colours! Generated from a simple JSON file! My mum likes the horizontal format (and it's easiest to implement), so I'll use this to make her a schedule of my classes every term. Hoping to eventually pull from the uWaterloo API to get the course info.</p>

<section class="project">
  <h1><a href="http://github.com/msrose/CarmelCubing">Carmel Cubing</a></h1>
  <img src="images/cubing.JPG" alt="Cubing"/>
  <p><b>Technology Stack</b>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
  <p>Hosted on Heroku: <a href="http://carmelcubing.herokuapp.com">carmelcubing.herokuapp.com</a></p>
  <p>This is the first website I ever made. It was for a Rubik's cube club I started in high school. I learned lots of CSS doing this - in hindsight the structure of the code is poor (I was a novice), but I'm very pleased with the final product in terms of appearance.</p>
